# StartIt
A small application that can make your desktop simple and smooth, based on Qt.

StartIt User Manual
Basic Operations & Interactions
Add an App:​ Simply drag and drop any file (.exe, .lnk, image, etc.) from your desktop onto the Dock area.
Open Settings:​ Right-click anywhere on the Dock (including on an icon) and select "Settings".
Move the Dock:​ Click and hold the main icon (the gear/folder) with the left mouse button, then drag to reposition the entire window.
Remove an App:​ Click, hold, and drag an app icon far away from the Dock. Other icons will turn dim/grey, indicating "Delete Mode" is active. Release to remove the app.
Reorder Apps:​ Drag icons left/right (or up/down) within the Dock to swap their positions.

Immersive Wheel Control
A power-user mode to launch apps quickly without clicking:
Activate:​ Hover your mouse over the Dock and scroll the mouse wheel.
Navigate:​ The mouse cursor will hide. Continue scrolling – the focus will cycle between icons (they will enlarge).
Confirm:​ Once the target is selected, left-click (no need to aim precisely) to open the app.
Exit:​ Simply move the mouse significantly (to prevent accidental triggers) and the cursor will reappear.
Note:​ The wheel uses an anti-accidental-scroll algorithm. It requires a certain scroll distance to switch focus, providing a more solid, intentional feel.

NEW Feature: Persistent App Names
If some of your app icons look too similar, or you just want your desktop to feel more lively:
●   Select the app in the "Apps" list within Settings.
●   Check the box for "Always Show Name" on the right.
●   Now, the name will always be shown next to the icon, regardless of whether you're hovering over it.
